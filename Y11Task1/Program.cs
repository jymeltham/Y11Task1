             * Happy Numbers 
             * A happy number is defined by the following process: 
             * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
             * and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops 
             * endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 
             * are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. 
             * Display an example of your output here. Find the first eight happy numbers.
             * 
             *  Mor-se Coding 
             * Create a program that allows you to enter a string and encode it into Morse code, using ‘ . ‘ 
             * and ‘ - ‘ notation. Spaces between words should be replaced with the “|” (pipe) character. 
             * Use a normal space for gaps between each character.
             * Extension:
             * 1. Develop your program to translate from Morse to alphanumeric, using the standards above
             *
